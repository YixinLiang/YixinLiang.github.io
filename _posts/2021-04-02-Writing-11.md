<p>STA305 Week 11 Writing
<p>Key Results 
<p>According to the study, females have a higher odds of wanting to lose weight than males. Also, people with greater BMI percentiles have a stronger incentive to reduce their weight after controlling the sex. Additionally, based on the results, the odds for wanting to lose weight are not correlated to participation in sports games and TV watching. 

<p>Limitations
<p>There are several limitations that exist in the study. Firstly, the missing responses are deleted in order to use complete respondents to make the model. This reduces the available sample and may introduce bias. Secondly, there may be different interpretations about the definition used in the model. Using sports games as an example, people who spend significant time on one sport may endure more pressure than people who spread their energy into three different sports. Additionally, this study does not mention those who try to lose weight though they already have a low BMI. Also, the negative influence of losing weight is not mentioned in this study. Finally, using a larger data set to conduct the analysis may lead to more precise results.  

<p>Conclusion
<p>In conclusion, the odds of wanting to lose weight are related to the sex and BMI percentiles, which is unrelated to participation in sports games and TV watching. However, there are also some improvement can be made in the further analysis, such as make a more comprehensive definition and increasing sample size.
