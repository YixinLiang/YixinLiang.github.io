<p>STA303 Writing 10
<p>Study design
<p>This study tried to investigate whether the officials in NACC men’s college basketball tend to “even out” foul calls throughout a game.
<p>Setting
<p>Data involved in this study were collected over 340 games, which are from the Big Ten, ACC, and Big East conference seasons from 2009 to 2010.
<p>Participants
<p>There are 4972 fouls from 340 games collected. This data collected only focuses on fouls called during the first half and not collected the fouls during the second half. This can help to prevent the study from being influenced by intentional fouls.
<p>Data sources/ measurement
<p>The source of data is from 3 conference seasons. The response variable is whether the foul was called on the home team, a binary variable. Five one-level independent variables are the game situation when foul was called, the type of foul called, time remaining, foul differential and score differences. The first two variables are categorical, and the others are numerical variables.
<p>Statistical methods
<p>(a) Describe all statistical methods
A multi-level model is applied in this study. The home team and visiting team are treated as two primary Level Two covariates because the number of fouls is associated with the location that the game played.
<p>(c) Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential confounders, and effect modifiers. Explain how quantitative variables were handled in the analyses.
Because the P-value related to foul differential is less than 0.01, we have significant evidence that there is a negative relationship between foul differential and the odds of a home team foul. Therefore, we can conclude that the team has more total fouls when they are a home team compared with the situation that they are acting as the visiting team.
