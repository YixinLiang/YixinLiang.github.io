<p>According to the study, 248 out of 319 preterm newborns participate in the first three follow-up lung function tests and 247 preterm newborns engage in the fourth test. Based on the first test results, the average test value for the preterm newborns who accept the treatment is -1.19. This is lower than the average test value of those experiment units, which receive treatment two. The adjusted difference in mean for test one is 0.23. Four tests all indicate that preterm newborns who use the second treatment have a better lung function after growing up because the test value is less negative than the treatment one. Except for the third test, the other three tests are all statistically significant because the adjusted difference's confidence interval does not contain zero.

<p>In conclusion, based on the experiment results, compared with treatment one, four lung function tests demonstrate that treatment two helps preterm newborns to develop their lungs more efficiently and will lead to a better lung function 11 to 14 years later.
